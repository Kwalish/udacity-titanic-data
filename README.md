# udacity-titanic-data

This is my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree's Intro to Data Analysis and the goal was to uncover insights from Kaggle's Titanic Dataset.

Through this project, I tried to find which variables had affected the most the chance of survival of passengers.

I found that the two most important variables for survival were Class and Gender. 

These two variables could lead to a difference of up to 80% of chance of survival between the most "lucky" and "unlucky' group.
